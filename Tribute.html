    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (1875–1950) was one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian freedom movement and 
      a key figure in shaping modern India. Popularly known as the “Iron Man of India,” Patel’s firm leadership and 
      vision helped unite over 560 princely states into a single nation after independence.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
    <p>
      Born on October 31, 1875, in Nadiad, Gujarat, Vallabhbhai Patel grew up with strong moral and leadership values. 
      He completed his law studies in England and later became a successful lawyer in Ahmedabad. His entry into politics 
      was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals of truth and non-violence.
    </p>

    <h2>Role in Freedom Struggle</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Played a crucial role in organizing peasants in Gujarat against oppressive policies of the British government.</li>
      <li>Was one of the top leaders in the Indian National Congress and a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi.</li>
      <li>Led several movements including the Bardoli Satyagraha, which earned him the title “Sardar”.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Post-Independence Contributions</h2>
    <p>
      After India gained independence, Patel became the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India. 
      His greatest contribution was the unification of over 560 princely states into the Indian Union — a herculean task 
      that prevented the country from disintegration.
    </p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Sardar Patel’s leadership, dedication, and vision for a strong and united India left an everlasting mark on the 
      nation’s history. The <strong>Statue of Unity</strong> in Gujarat — the world’s tallest statue — stands as a tribute 
      to his immense contribution.
